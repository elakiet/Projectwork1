## Title of the Project
AI-POWERED DETECTION OF FAKE NEWS AND NEWS CATEGORIZATION USING NLP

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
This project aims to tackle the growing issue of misinformation by utilizing AI-powered Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for detecting fake news and categorizing news articles into relevant genres. By leveraging machine learning models and linguistic pattern recognition, it effectively distinguishes between trustworthy and deceptive content. The system provides users with a reliable tool to combat fake news, enhance public awareness, and promote informed decision-making in today's information-rich digital landscape.

## Features
<!--List the features of the project as shown below-->
- Fake news detection using NLP techniques.
- News categorization by genre or topic.
- Machine learning integration for improved accuracy.
- Linguistic pattern recognition for deeper analysis.
- Real-time analysis and feedback system.
